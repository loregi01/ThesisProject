# Something about the files
The file "log_tesi_new.xes" is a toy file used to avoid the user to download a .xes file that can result too heavy, but you can delete it. Instead the "user_file.xes" cannot be deleted in any case since it's the file used to copy the content of the file selected by the user, so it's rewritten every time the user selects a new .xes file.
